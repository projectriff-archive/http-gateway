= HTTP Gateway

== Purpose
The *http gateway* runs accepts http requests and trasforms those to messages emitted on the broker.
Optionally (when posting to the `/requests/\{topic\}` endpoint) it waits for a reply on a dedicated internal topic
and marshalls that message as an http response.

== Development
=== Prerequisites
The following tools are required to build this project:

- `make`
- Docker
- https://github.com/Masterminds/glide#install[Glide] for dependency management

If you intend to re-generate mocks for testing, install:

- https://github.com/vektra/mockery#installation[Mockery]

If you would like to run tests using the `ginkgo` command, install:

- http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/[Ginkgo]

=== Get the source
[source, bash]
----
cd $(go env GOPATH)   #defaults to ~/go
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/projectriff/http-gateway src/github.com/projectriff/http-gateway
----

=== Building
* To build locally (this will produce a binary named `http-gateway` on _your_ machine):
+
[source, bash]
----
make build
----

* To build for docker (and deploy as part of the whole https://github.com/projectriff/riff#-manual-install-of-riff[riff]
installation):
+
[source, bash]
----
make dockerize
----
This assumes that your docker client is correctly configured to target the daemon where you want the image built.

* To run tests:
+
[source, bash]
----
make test
----

* To attach a https://github.com/derekparker/delve/blob/master/Documentation/EditorIntegration.md[delve capable] debugger (such as Goland)
to an `http-gateway` running _inside_ k8s:
+
[source, bash]
----
make debug-dockerize
----
Then expose the `2345` port as a service, using `riff/config/delve/http-gateway-debug.yaml`:
+
[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f riff/config/delve/http-gateway-debug.yaml
----
Then you can connect the debugger through port `30100`.
